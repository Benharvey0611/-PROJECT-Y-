  COURSE GOALS ACOMPLISHED THROUGH MAKINGS 1-9:
  Engaging in sustainable resarch has sharpened my information allocation
  skills as I've had to dive into several YouTube videos and online
  forums for code knowledge exchange in order to hone in on a particular
  set of interests surrounding new digital media. Learning to play with
  webtext during the beginning of the course proved to be useful later
  down the line as we moved towards integrating that base level
  knowledge into new forms. This was all part of the first phase of
  makings (1-3) and was a fundamental, rudementary step in this creative
  process. As we've moved into the second phase, we had to think more
  deeply about craft and how we would reflect our intended message and
  theme through a comprehensible and aethetic format. This is where I
  really started to find my own "knack" for the digital media creation
  process. I knew I wanted to do something unique in whatever it is
  I was presenting. Using new media software like Premier Pro was
  extremely exciting and allowed me to learn new skills on the program.
  Every video compilation/edit I made, I did so with the intention
  to challenge myself to learn a new type of effect for the making.
  The final goal acomloshed in these makings presented itself in the
  character creation making. This new program was very intuitive and
  made the daunting task of character animation seem much more possible.
  Through the entire process, I've been challegned in the best way I
  could have been. Everything I've learned as a result of having to
  craft new skills has only become more smoothly intergrated into my
  creation process which has only led to more advancement in my own
  groove.
